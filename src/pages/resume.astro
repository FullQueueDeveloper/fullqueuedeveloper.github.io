        <P>I’m linking to this app from Daniel Ramteke for several reasons. First, it’s an excellent (and free) way to play with the various haptic parameters to get precisely the desired effect. Secondly, Daniel streamed the entire development of this app on his Twitch channel and uploaded all 13 session recordings to YouTube.</P>

        <P>In addition to the MTA's online Subway Times, which offers the current arrival times by line and station and is accessible from the internet even beyond the subway's hallowed platforms, Underway NYC now offers the same information but in app form and plotted to a subway map.</P>

          <div><SecondaryLink  href="https://underway.nyc">Project: Underway</SecondaryLink></div>
          <P>Underway is marvelous. It is the navigation app that I use most consistently on the train, and for good reason. It has exactly the information I need and nothing more, and it executes it perfectly. I know how to read a map. I don’t need colorful directions and an inventive new route that combines ferries, buses, and a dollar van. I want to know when I need to leave my apartment and if it’s worth it to wait for an express train. Underway gets me the information I want and it does it without drama. It also has lots of very thoughtful touches. It works very well offline, and I like that I can send a train tracking link to people I’m meeting so that they can track me live. It’s like flight tracking but for the subway. For all its utility and minimalism, Underway also betrays the meticulousness of its creators. Changes to the subway map are added right away — the walking connection between Times Square and Bryant Park seemed to appear within hours after it opened. Everything works how I need it to, when I need it to. The only thing that might need some more nuanced adjustment is the service change interface, which shows absolutely everything affecting a train at once and can be a touch overwhelming. Other apps do service changes, though. Nothing does what Underway does as well as Underway does it. I haven’t even written an app review in years. I just feel I have a duty to point out the rare thing in our world that is not a disgusting disappointment. This is among them. Bravo!</P>
