# Episode 6. Dreaming about future keyboards

I'm very happy with my Corne LP. I wish it had slightly more pinky stagger, because my pinky's need to stretch to hit the top row.

## Cornish Zen

While looking for a Corne, I found out about the Cornish Zen. It was a group buy I had just missed. In addition to looking gourgeous, it has deeper pinky stagger.

Round three of the group buy has been announced! Here are photos from the creator [https://imgur.com/user/darryldh/posts](https://imgur.com/user/darryldh/posts)

I'm honestly torn on buying even more keyboards. This one uses ZMK firmware instead of QMK firmware, so I would have to translate everything over. I'm not sure I would benefit from the Bluetooth features since I only type on my desk for my wrists sake.

## Chocofi

Someone on the BoardSource Discord posted a picture of their [Chocofi](https://github.com/pashutk/chocofi), which looks like a 3x5 Corne, but with deeper pinky stagger. However I probably will never sauter my own keyboard. I build software not hardware.
