# Episode 0. Apple Magic Keyboard

The first time I placed my fingers on the Apple Magic Keyboard, I instantly fell in love with it.

It's so small! The short travel distance of the keys. The light actuation force. The linear key press. The small footprint. The removed number pad. Rechargeable. Wired _and_ wireless. Elegance!

This was the first keyboard I was ever excited about. And I kept buying them over the years.

My wrists however told me that this keyboard would no longer work for them in Spring of 2021.
