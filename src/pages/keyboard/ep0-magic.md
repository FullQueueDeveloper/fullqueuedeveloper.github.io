# Episode 0. Apple Magic Keyboard

The first time I placed my fingers on the Apple Magic Keyboard, I instantly fell in love with it. It's so small! The short travel distance of the keys. The light acuation force. The linear key press. The small footprint. The removed numberpad. Rechargable. Wired _and_ wireless. Elegance!

This was the first keyboard I was ever excited about. And I kept buying them over the years.
