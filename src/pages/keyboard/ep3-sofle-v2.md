# Episode 3. Ergomech Sofle v2

I read a lot of Reddit posts in r/mechanicalkeyboads, r/ergomechkeyboads, r/olkbd. I learned that the Moonlander's ortholinear layout doesn't match the different lengths of human fingers. I learned about column-stagger vs row-stagger.

On these subreddits, I learned about open source keyboards. Someone will design a keyboard and post to GitHub the specifications to print the components of the keyboard. So anyone can build the keyboard for themselves.

I also found [splitkbcompare](https://jhelvy.shinyapps.io/splitkbcompare/) a website to compare several of these open source keyboards

One of these keyboards was the Sofle v2.

The Sofle v2 caught my eye for several reasons. It was column-stagger (opposed to row-stagger or ortholinear). It has so many keys! In my head, I mapped out where all the keys would be. It had a number row. It had plenty of thumb buttons, I figured a few of them could be `Control`, `Command`, `Shift` and `Option`. It also has tow rotary knobs! I mapped one of them to volume and the other knob to switch between Mac and Windows.

## Acquiring a Sofle v2

Now I needed to get one.

And I needed a pre-built one. I did not want to build one myself. I'm a programmer, I'm bad at interacting with the physical world. Also, my small apartment doesn't have room for sautering. And plus I would need sautering equipment.

I googled and I searched for someone who sells pre-built Sofle V2's. It was hard to find! Then finally a reddit user recommended the services of another reddit user who builds keyboards!

I messaged with him back and forth for a long time about the all the options for the Sofle. He recommended Gateron Yellow switches. He had just finished designing an aluminum case that he was excited about. He patiently answered all my questions about tenting and wrist rests. I had thought I want wrist rests as part of the keyboard, like the [Kinesis Freestyle](/keyboard/ep1-freestyle)

I was planning on getting blank keycaps, because I didn't want the pressure of committing to a particular layout. I knew I would probably move around the modifier keys.

I told this to him, and he understandably sent me a mixed bag of keycaps for the keyboard. That was probably a mistake on my part. I did get blank keys.

## Shipping problems

One of the tenting legs broke during transport. Snapped in half!

Due to Covid-19, shipping from Vietnam took longer than usual.

Maybe this is why folks are reluctant to ship pre-built keyboards to customers. It's so much easier to find kits or parts.

## Usage

The Sofle v2 felt amazing! The Gateron Yellow keyswitches felt so satisfying.

## Conclusion

The Sofle v2 was a nice transition to columnar stagger. With the many keys that it has, I was able to experiment with different layouts, and try out the Miryoku layout.
