    <h1 id="episode-1-kinesis-freestyle">Episode 1. Kinesis Freestyle</h1><p>I was desperate. I google’d a lot. Ergonomic keyboards reminded me of keyboards like the Microsoft Sculpt. And I did not want to end up with something bulky like that.</p><p>Wirecutter’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-keyboards/">article on keyboards</a> recommended the Kinesis Freestyle Edge with tenting kit. The tenting kit angles the two halves of the keyboard up towards the center: <code>/ \</code></p><p>The Freestyle a split keyboard, which means the two sides of the keyboard are not attached. This took a little getting used to, since I would often type the “B” key with my right hand, but this was now far away from my right. However, it was worth it for the almost immediate benefits of the tenting.</p><p>The Freestyle’s tenting kit angles the two halves of the keyboard up towards the center. <code>/ \</code> This allows the wrists to rest at a natural angle. The Freestyle’s tenting kit allows many different angles, so I was able to find the angle that worked best for me. This was a nice feature since I was a beginner at the time.</p><p>It had 3 options for switches: red (linear), brown (tactile), blue (clicky). I wanted to try out the browns.</p><p>The keyboard was a bit big for my taste.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This was a fantastic first purchase. It helped me get used to a split keyboard. And the tenting relieved my wrist pain almost immediately.</p>
